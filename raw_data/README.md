## Datasets

### Accelerometer Data for Gesture Recognition

The `imu-acc-export.zip` file contains accelerometer data collected with the **XIAO nRF54L15 Sense**.

This dataset includes four different gesture patterns:
*   `idle`
*   `circle`
*   `updown`
*   `flick`

You can upload this data directly to **Edge Impulse** to train a gesture recognition model.

### Voice Data for Voice Recognition

You can test the voice recognition functionality without recording your own audio by using the sample dataset from the TFLite-Micro project. This dataset includes simple voice commands like "Yes", "No", "Up", "Down," and more.

The data is available in the following repository:
*   **[TFLite-Micro Speech Training Data](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech/train)**
